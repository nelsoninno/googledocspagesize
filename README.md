How to install this extension (super easy!)

1. Go to Google Docs, open your file, or start a new one.
2. On the top menu, click on Extensions.
3. Then click on Apps Script
4. A new window will appear, press where it says "Untitled Project" and give it a name, for example "Page Size Manager"
5. On the left sidebar, click on Code.gs to make sure it is selected and highlighted with light blue.
6. Delete the code that looks like this:
```
function myFunction() {
  
}
```
7. Replace it with the entire code in the file called Code.gs from this GitHub.
8. Now, on the left sidebar, press on the "+" sign next to Files, and select HTML.
9. The new HMTL file will be called "Untitled" but you should rename it to "Sidebar"‚ö†Ô∏è!
10. Now copy & paste the code inside from the Sidebar.html file included in this GitHub.
11. On the top menu press on SAVE.
12. Select back Code.gs and press RUN. It will throw an error the first time, but just click on RUN again and it will work.
13. Google will prompt you to give authorization, click on Review Permissions.
14. Select your Google account, then go to Advanced and click on the grey button saying "Go to Page Size Manager (unsafe)" - the warning is normal for any unpublished App Scripts.
15. Press one more time on ALLOW, and go back to your Google Docs file.
16. One last time, click on Extensions.
17. A new option will show with the name of your project. Click on it and then on "Open Page Size Manager"
